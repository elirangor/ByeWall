# Changelog

## v1.8.1
- **Fixed URL normalization for news sites**: Added support for removing `gift` parameter (commonly used by Haaretz and other news sites for temporary access links). Extension now properly detects archived versions of articles even when accessed via gift URLs like `?gift=abc123`.

## v1.8
- **Streamlined keyboard shortcuts**  
  - `Ctrl+Shift+E` (`Cmd+Shift+E` on Mac): Open the extension  
  - `Ctrl+Shift+U` (`Cmd+Shift+U` on Mac): Instantly open the current page with your preferred service  

## v1.7.x
- **Intelligent fallback**: If Archive.today pre-check fails/times out, the extension now tries to open the archive anyway instead of showing an error
- **No empty tabs**: background pre-check for Archive.today (1s timeout) shows an inline "No snapshot available" instead.  
- **Faster popup**: warm pre-check on open, smaller HTML sniff, 100ms click debounce.  
- **CSP-safe + instant dark mode**: early script moved to `popup-early.js`; no white flash; fonts load non-blocking.  
- **Cleaner history**: dedupes by normalized URL (drops UTM/hash, trims slashes); keeps only the latest visit per page (max 5).  
- **Clearer radios**: unchecked = gray ring, checked = blue dot (clearer in light mode).

## üîç How It Decides to Open a Tab

### Archive.today Flow (with Smart Fallback):
1. Background checks `archive.today/newest/<url>` with 1-second timeout
2. **If pre-check succeeds and snapshot exists** ‚Üí opens the archive in a new tab  
3. **If pre-check fails (timeout/network error)** ‚Üí tries opening the archive anyway (fallback mechanism)
4. **If pre-check succeeds but "No results" found** ‚Üí shows message in popup (no tab opened)

This means Archive.today will almost always attempt to work, even when the pre-check service is temporarily slow or unavailable.

### Wayback Machine Flow:
- Unchanged - queries the API to confirm snapshot exists before opening

## üöÄ Why the Fallback Mechanism?

Archive.today's pre-check service can sometimes be slower than the actual archive service itself. Instead of frustrating users with "timeout" errors that require multiple clicks, the extension now intelligently falls back to trying the archive anyway. This provides a much smoother user experience while maintaining the speed benefits of the pre-check when it works.
