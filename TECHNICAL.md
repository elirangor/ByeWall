## üõ† Development Notes

- `popup.js` handles UI logic  
- `popup.html` - Clean, responsive interface with dark mode support
- `archive-core.js` - Core archive checking and URL processing logic
- `background.js` - Service worker for keyboard shortcuts and messaging
- No external dependencies  
- Simplified design - focused on reliability and ease of use  

### Special thanks to [@8288tom](https://github.com/8288tom) for improving the history functionality.

## üîí Security Features
- URL validation and XSS protection
- Rate limiting to prevent service abuse  
- Secure external link handling

## üîê Permissions

- `https://archive.today/*`, `https://archive.ph/*` ‚Äì Archive.today pre-checks  
- `https://web.archive.org/*`, `https://archive.org/*` ‚Äì Wayback lookups  
- `tabs`, `activeTab`, `storage` ‚Äì open result tab, read current URL, store prefs/history

## URL Normalization

The extension normalizes URLs before checking for archived versions to improve match accuracy. This process removes:

- Tracking parameters: `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_term`, `utm_content`, `utm_id`
- Social media tracking: `gclid`, `fbclid`, `mc_cid`, `mc_eid`
- News site access parameters: `gift` (used by Haaretz and similar sites)
- URL fragments (hash)
- Trailing slashes
- Default ports (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS)

This ensures that URLs like:
- `https://example.com/article?utm_source=twitter&gift=abc123#comment`
- `https://example.com/article/`

Are both normalized to:
- `https://example.com/article`

And can find the same archived version.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**archive-core.js** - Main business logic
- `performArchive()` - Main function that handles the archive process
- `precheckArchiveToday()` - Quick check for Archive.today snapshots
- `waybackHasSnapshotQuick()` - Quick check for Wayback snapshots
- `normalizeHistoryUrl()` - URL cleaning and normalization

**background.js** - Service worker
- Handles keyboard shortcuts
- Message passing between popup and core logic
- Opens popup when shortcuts fail (shows error messages)

**popup.js** - UI logic
- Dark mode toggle
- Service preference management
- History display
- Warm pre-checking on popup open

### Data Flow

1. User clicks "Read Behind the Wall" or uses keyboard shortcut
2. Extension gets current tab URL and title
3. URL is normalized (tracking parameters removed)
4. Based on selected service:
   - **Archive.today**: Quick pre-check ‚Üí open archive URL
   - **Wayback**: API check ‚Üí get latest snapshot ‚Üí open
5. Save to history and open in new tab

### Error Handling

The extension handles various error conditions gracefully:
- Invalid URLs
- Unsupported page types (chrome://, file://, etc.)
- Network timeouts
- Service unavailability
- No archived versions available

Instead of silent failures, users receive clear messages about what went wrong.
